### Project Goal

The aim of this project is to create several methods that act like the ruby enumerables as specified on the [Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks) and to create test cases for these methods using RSpec.



### Project Achieved
* The methods were created using Ruby;
* Blocks were called using "yield" and Procs
* These can be used on arrays to perform the same actions the original ruby methods would
* Test cases were added to our version of ruby's enumerable methods using RSpec
